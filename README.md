This game was created as a submission for the BUET CSE Fest 2023 Game Jam and was selected as one of the top 15 games for the final onsite round. The theme of the game jam was **You Are Your Own Enemy**.

**Whispering Shadow** is an interactive and immersive action-adventure game that challenges players to navigate a village infested with hidden monsters disguised as innocent villagers. As the hero, you must embark on a perilous mission to save the village from these lurking creatures. However, the game introduces a moral dilemma - killing innocent villagers will strengthen your dark conscience. The choices you make will impact not only the fate of the village but also your own soul.
