# GameJam-2023
This is a game we made for the "BUET CSE Fest GameJam-2023"

Embark on a thrilling adventure in a village overrun by hidden monsters disguised as innocent villagers.

As the hero of this tale, your mission is clear: save the village by eliminating these lurking creatures. But beware! Killing innocentvillagers will only empower your own dark conscience.

As you progress, your evil conscience grows stronger, tempting you to embrace the darkness. The choice is yours. Will you fight against it to preserve your humanity, or succumb to its alluring power? 

Ultimately, you must confront the unsettling truth: are you your own enemy? Your decisions will shape the fate of the village and your own soul.
